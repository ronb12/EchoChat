# Documentation

This directory groups product documentation, reports, and assets generated during EchoDynamo development.

- `reports/` – historical reports, test summaries, and operational notes that were previously spread across the project root.
- `plans/` – forward-looking feature plans and architectural notes.
- `assets/screenshots/` – marketing or documentation screenshots used in project communication.
- `archive/` – deprecated assets retained for reference (for example, the legacy standalone service worker).

Keeping these resources in a single location keeps the repository root focused on source code while preserving valuable historical context.
